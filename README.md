<hr/>

### Who am I?
<h5 align="left">I'm originally from Sri Lanka but currently living in The Finland with my Wife and my little boy (Errol). I really enjoy learning langauges, libraries & frameworks like Next.js, React, NodeJS, C# etc. as well as work with WordPress. Programming is a a second nature to me apart from taking care of my family.</h5>
<!--
I'm a tech enthusiast who would like to explore new technologies, not just programming languages but also devices.
I love to share knowledge with the rest of the world, and that's why I write articles and make YouTube videos.
Since I'm (still) learning Software Engineering, I also like to share my code so others can make use of them.
